# PRODIGY_CS_01-Caesar-Cipher-
This Caesar Cipher Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters through a specified value. It supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Users can choose between encryption, decryption, or exit the program. The shift value can be positive or negative, providing flexibility in message transformation. Input validation ensures that the shift is an integer, reducing errors. The program handles user input via a simple command-line interface. The core functionality relies on character manipulation using the ASCII values. It efficiently cycles through the alphabet using modulus arithmetic. This program is a beginner-friendly demonstration of classical cryptography.
